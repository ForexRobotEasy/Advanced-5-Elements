# Advanced 5 Elements

This is the code for the Advanced 5 Elements expert advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. 

This expert advisor is designed to implement a trend strategy and provide capital protection and risk management features. It is intended to be used for automated trading on the Forex market.

## How it Works

### Libraries
The necessary libraries, Trade.mqh, Expert.mqh, and ArrayObj.mqh, are included.

### Global Variables
The expert advisor initializes the following global variables:
- `trade`: An object of the CTrade class for performing trading operations.
- `expert`: An object of the CExpert class for executing the expert advisor's functions.
- `orders`: An array object of the CArrayObj class for storing open orders.

### Trend Strategy
The `TrendStrategy` function is defined to implement the logic for trend analysis and trading decisions. The specific implementation is not provided in the code and should be added by the user.

### Capital Protection
The `CapitalProtection` function is defined to set the stop loss (SL) feature to protect capital. In this code, the stop loss is set to 50 pips.

### Super Protection
The `SuperProtection` function is defined to check for drawdown and close orders ahead of schedule. If the drawdown exceeds 10%, all open orders are closed, and the expert advisor is stopped.

### Risk Manager
The `RiskManager` function is defined to implement risk management logic. The specific implementation is not provided in the code and should be added by the user.

### Initialization
The `OnInit` function is called when the expert advisor is initialized. It registers the functions `TrendStrategy`, `CapitalProtection`, `SuperProtection`, and `RiskManager` with the expert advisor. Auto-trading mode is enabled.

### Execution
The `OnTick` function is called on each tick. It executes the registered functions in the specified order using the `expert.Execute()` method.

### Termination
The `OnDeinit` function is called when the expert advisor is terminated. It displays a message indicating the termination reason.

## Product Description

Advanced 5 Elements is an expert advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to provide automated trading solutions with a focus on trend analysis and capital protection.

This expert advisor incorporates a trend strategy function that allows users to implement their own trend analysis logic and make informed trading decisions based on the analysis.

To protect capital, Advanced 5 Elements includes a capital protection mechanism that sets a stop loss (SL) feature. The SL is defined as 50 pips in this code, but it can be adjusted according to the user's preferences.

In addition, the Super Protection system is implemented to monitor drawdown and close orders if the drawdown exceeds 10%. This feature helps to minimize potential losses and safeguard investments.

Advanced 5 Elements also provides a Risk Manager function that enables users to implement their own risk management rules to further protect their investments.
